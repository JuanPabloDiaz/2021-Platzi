# Datacademy

## Platzi Challenge | 2022

This repo is part of the Datacademy Challenge I took back on February 2022. I learned a lot from the experience and developed many skills. [Python](https://platzi.com/blog/python/), terminal bash, [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com/) and [Descriptive statistics]() are some of the tools I used.

This challenge is part of the new "Escuela de Data Science e Inteligencia Artificial" on Platzi. I had the opportunity to learn different tools use in the data science field. I also learned the different learning paths to become a **Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Data Engineer & Machine Learning Engineer** on Platzi.

## Final Project

In this repo you will find a final project in which I merged multiple skills I learned during the challenge. The project was created on Deepnote and can be access by clicking the following link: [Analysis of the 25 largest retailers in the United States](https://deepnote.com/workspace/juandiaz-7746519b-662c-4b7c-b97f-9577567b2970/project/Proyecto-Datacademy-b6457371-4e49-4f83-96ab-1232331cf711/%2FdataProyect%2Ftemplate_proyecto_datacademy.ipynb)
