This repo is part of the Datacademy Challenge I took back on February 2022. I learned a lot from the experience and developed many skills. [Python](https://platzi.com/blog/python/), terminal bash, [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com/) and [Descriptive statistics]() are some of the tools I used.

This challenge is part of the new "Escuela de Data Science e Inteligencia Artificial" on Platzi. I had the opportunity to learn different tools use in the data science field. I also learned the different learning paths to become a **Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Data Engineer & Machine Learning Engineer** on Platzi.

## Final Project

In this repo you will find a final project in which I merged multiple skills I learned during the challenge. The project was created on Deepnote and can be access by clicking the following link: [Analysis of the 25 largest retailers in the United States](https://deepnote.com/workspace/juandiaz-7746519b-662c-4b7c-b97f-9577567b2970/project/Proyecto-Datacademy-b6457371-4e49-4f83-96ab-1232331cf711/%2FdataProyect%2Ftemplate_proyecto_datacademy.ipynb)

## Temas a tratar en el Datacademy:

1. Basic Python, libraries and more.
2. How to use tools such as **Jupyter Notebooks** in the cloud using Google Colab y Deepnote.
3. Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib.
4. Descriptive statistics for data science.
5. How data is used in companies and organizations.
6. What roles exist in the industry, what they do and how to choose one.
